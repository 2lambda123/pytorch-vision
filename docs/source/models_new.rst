Models and pre-trained weights - New
####################################

.. note::

    These are the new models docs, documenting the new multi-weight API.
    TODO: Once all is done, remove the "- New" part in the title above, and
    rename this file as models.rst


The ``torchvision.models`` subpackage contains definitions of models for addressing
different tasks, including: image classification, pixelwise semantic
segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, person
keypoint detection, video classification, and optical flow.

.. note ::
    Backward compatibility is guaranteed for loading a serialized 
    ``state_dict`` to the model created using old PyTorch version. 
    On the contrary, loading entire saved models or serialized 
    ``ScriptModules`` (seralized using older versions of PyTorch) 
    may not preserve the historic behaviour. Refer to the following 
    `documentation 
    <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html#id6>`_
