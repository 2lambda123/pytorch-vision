EfficientNet
============

.. currentmodule:: torchvision.models

The AlexNet model is based on the `One weird trick... <https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997>`__
paper.


Model builders
--------------

The following model builders can be used to instanciate an AlexNet model, with or
without pre-trained weights. All the model builders internally rely on the
``torchvision.models.alexnet.AlexNet`` base class. Please refer to the `source
code
<https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/alexnet.py>`_ for
more details about this class.
