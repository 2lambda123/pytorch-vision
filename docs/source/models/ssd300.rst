SSD300
==========

.. currentmodule:: torchvision.models.detection

The SSD300 model is based on the `SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector 
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325>`__ paper.


Model builders
--------------

The following model builders can be used to instanciate a SSD300 model, with or
without pre-trained weights. All the model builders internally rely on the
``torchvision.models.squeezenet.SqueezeNet`` base class. Please refer to the `source
code
<https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/detection/ssd.py>`_ for
more details about this class.
