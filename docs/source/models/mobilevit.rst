MobileViT
===========

.. currentmodule:: torchvision.models

The MobileViT model is based on the `"MobileViT: Light-Weight, General-Purpose, and Mobile-Friendly Vision Transfomer" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02178>`__ paper.


Model builders
--------------

The following model builders can be used to instantiate a MobileViT model, with or
without pre-trained weights. All the model builders internally rely on the
``torchvision.models.mobilevit.MobileViT`` base class. Please refer to the `source
code
<https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/mobilevit.py>`_ for
more details about this class.
