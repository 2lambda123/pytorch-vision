The new API:
    ☐ the c++ extension is going to live in torchvision/csrc/cpu/video
    ☐ modification of the build needs to go to setup.py
    ☐ torchvision/io/_video something needs to happen somehow

Tests changes:
    ☐ test/test_io.py
    ☐ test/test_video_reader.py (change to test video api)



Implementation:
    ☐ Datatype for strem
    ☐ Datatype for container
    ☐ Do I use tensor as a type in metadata
