Prior to v0.8.0, transforms in torchvision have traditionally been PIL-centric and presented multiple limitations due to 
that. Now, since v0.8.0, transforms implementations are Tensor and PIL compatible and we can achieve the following new 
features:
- transform multi-band torch tensor images (with more than 3-4 channels) 
- torchscript transforms together with your model for deployment
- support for GPU acceleration
- batched transformation such as for videos
- read and decode data directly as torch tensor with torchscript support (for PNG and JPEG image formats)
